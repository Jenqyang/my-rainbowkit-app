# Sound NFT Project (Based on Bitcoin Blockchain)

## Project Objective

This project aims to explore and develop a sound NFT (Non-Fungible Token) based on the Bitcoin blockchain. The goal is to create unique, verifiable ownership digital assets for sound content (such as music, voice, special sound effects, etc.).

## Current Status

The core logic design and development of the Stacks smart contract (`sound-capsule-nft.clar`) for managing sound NFTs has been preliminarily completed.

This file is used to record users' specific ideas, detailed requirements, and design thoughts about sound NFTs.

## `sound-capsule-nft.clar` Smart Contract Description

This is a Clarity smart contract designed for the "Sound Capsule" project on the Stacks blockchain.

### Core Functions:

1.  **NFT Definition**:
    *   Defines an NFT named `sound-capsule`, compliant with the Stacks SIP-009 NFT standard.
    *   Each NFT has a unique numeric ID.

2.  **Metadata Association**:
    *   Uses `token-uri-map` to store the metadata URI corresponding to each NFT ID (typically pointing to a JSON file on IPFS, which contains the CID of the sound file and other descriptive information).

3.  **Minting**:
    *   The `mint` function is used to create new sound NFTs.
    *   Permission control:
        *   The contract deployer (`contract-owner`) can mint directly.
        *   The contract deployer can add other addresses to the `minter-whitelist` using the `add-minter` function, allowing whitelisted addresses to call the `mint` function.
        *   The contract deployer can remove addresses from the whitelist using the `remove-minter` function.
    *   Minting requires providing the recipient's address and the metadata URI for the NFT.

4.  **Transfer**:
    *   Standard `transfer` function, allowing the current owner of an NFT to transfer it to other Stacks addresses.
    *   Follows the SIP-009 standard, ensuring compatibility with other Stacks NFT applications.

5.  **Query (Read-Only Functions)**:
    *   `get-owner`: Query the current owner of a specified NFT ID.
    *   `get-token-uri`: Query the metadata URI corresponding to a specified NFT ID.
    *   `get-balance`: Query the number of `sound-capsule` NFTs owned by a specified address.
    *   `get-last-token-id`: Get the ID of the last minted NFT, which can be used to understand the total number of NFTs issued.

6.  **Royalty Management (Compliant with SIP-018 Standard)**:
    *   Uses `nft-royalty-map` to store the royalty recipient (`recipient`) and royalty percentage (`bps` - basis points, e.g., u500 represents 5%) separately for each NFT ID.
    *   The public function `set-royalty-for-nft` allows the contract owner (`contract-owner`) to set or update royalty information for a specified NFT. This function verifies that the royalty percentage does not exceed 100% (u10000 bps).
    *   The read-only function `get-royalty-info` follows the SIP-018 standard. It takes the NFT ID and the sale price of the NFT as parameters, then calculates and returns the royalty amount to be paid and the royalty recipient. If an NFT has not been explicitly set with royalty information, it defaults to 0 royalty with the contract owner as the recipient.

### Optional Features Not Included (Based on Current Requirements):

*   **Maximum Supply**: No fixed upper limit for the total number of NFTs has been set.
*   **Metadata Update**: Does not allow modification of metadata URI after NFT minting.

## Summary and Future Outlook

### Current Phase Achievements:

We have successfully designed and written the core framework of the `sound-capsule-nft.clar` smart contract. This contract implements basic NFT functionality and provides a flexible minting permission management mechanism based on user requirements. This lays a solid foundation for the implementation of the "Sound Capsule" project in the Stacks ecosystem.

### Potential Issues and Improvement Suggestions:

1.  **Security Audit and Testing**:
    *   **Suggestion**: Although the Clarity language design emphasizes security, it is strongly recommended to conduct comprehensive unit testing and integration testing before formal deployment to the mainnet. Consider seeking professional third-party security audits, especially for permission management (such as permission checks in `add-minter`, `remove-minter`, `mint`) and potential interactions with other contracts.
    *   **Consideration**: Ensuring the security of the `contract-owner`'s private key is crucial.

2.  **Scalability and Modularity**:
    *   **Current Status**: The current contract integrates core NFT functionalities.
    *   **Suggestion**: If more complex functionalities need to be expanded in the future (such as secondary market trading logic, auction mechanisms, more complex royalty distribution, governance functions, etc.), consider designing these features as independent new contracts or modules that can interact with the current NFT contract, to maintain the simplicity of the main NFT contract.

3.  **Gas Fee Optimization**:
    *   **Current Status**: The determinism of Clarity helps predict transaction costs.
    *   **Suggestion**: For future functionalities that may involve batch operations (such as batch minting, airdrops) or complex calculations, carefully evaluate their Gas consumption and explore optimization solutions to reduce user costs.

4.  **Frontend User Experience**:
    *   **Consideration**: Smart contracts are backend logic. An excellent user experience requires a well-designed frontend application. The frontend should facilitate easy interaction with the contract, for example:
        *   Interface for contract owners to manage the whitelist.
        *   Process for authorized users to upload sounds, fill in metadata, and request NFT minting.
        *   Interface for displaying and playing sound NFTs.

5.  **Metadata Standards and Richness**:
    *   **Current Status**: The contract only stores `token-uri`, pointing to external metadata.
    *   **Suggestion**: Consider establishing detailed metadata standards (e.g., what fields should be included in the off-chain JSON file: sound description, creator, creation date, emotion tags, CID of the sound file itself, cover image URI, etc.) to enhance the expressiveness, discoverability, and cross-platform interoperability of NFTs. You can refer to metadata recommendations from platforms like OpenSea.

6.  **Upgrades and Governance**:
    *   **Consideration**: Smart contracts are usually difficult to modify once deployed. For long-term projects, consider potential upgrade paths and governance mechanisms early in the project (e.g., how to fix potential bugs, how to adjust parameters based on community feedback, etc.). The Stacks ecosystem provides some contract upgrade patterns, but they need to be designed carefully.

We hope these considerations provide some useful references for the subsequent development of your project!
